# Python-Sample-App-Part-One
Part One of the code for the Python Sample Application used in DTSL7 module CETM65: Software Engineering Principles

Here we have started sketching out what classes and functions our application may have.

Any classes/functions we don't know what we are doing with yet we just add ***pass*** to.

All code is in one main file and initial object tests are done by intialising object variables, no user menu yet.

Instructions:

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Run code with:
    ``` python main.py ```
